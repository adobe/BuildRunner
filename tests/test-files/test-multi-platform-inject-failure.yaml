  # inject:
  #   # Each entry in the map has a glob pattern key that resolves relative
  #   # to the source tree root with the value being the directory within
  #   # the build context that the file(s) should be copied to. These files
  #   # will be available to the Dockerfile at the given location during
  #   # the Docker build.  Destination directories must have a trailing
  #   # slash (``/``).
  #   glob/to/files.*: dest/dir/
  #   path/to/file1.txt: dest/dir/
  #   path/to/file2.txt: .
  #   path/to/file3.txt: dest/filename.txt
