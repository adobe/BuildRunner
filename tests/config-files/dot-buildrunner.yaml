# The 'ssh-keys' global configuration is a list of ssh key configurations.
# The file attribute specifies the path to a local ssh private key. The key
# attribute provides a ASCII-armored private key. Only one or the other is
# required. If the private key is password protected the password attribute
# specifies the password. The alias attribute is a list of aliases assigned
# to the given key (see the "ssh-keys" configuration example of the "run"
# step attribute below).
